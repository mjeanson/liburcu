Description: userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library - development files
 This data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales
 linearly with the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiples copies of
 a given data structure to live at the same time, and by monitoring the data
 structure accesses to detect grace periods after which memory reclamation is
 possible.

 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using the
